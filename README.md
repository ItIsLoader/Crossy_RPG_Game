Crossy_RPG_Game Version 1.0 6/29/2019
Crossy-Road inspired game that was made as a direct tutorial from the Zenva Academy: "Learn Python by Programming a Game" Course.

GENERAL NOTES:
---------------
- Controls in this game are the up and down arrow keys. No other keys are needed for this game.
- The objective of this game is to avoid the enemy "goombas" and to make it to the treasure.
  Hitting the any of the enemies will result in the programming terminating itself.
  The game will get progressively more difficult as you succeed, and will eventually add more enemies.
- This game was made in IDLE with Python version 3.6.2, using the pygame library, version 1.9.6.

Goomba and Mario are properties of, and belong to, Nintendo. They are not my characters.
